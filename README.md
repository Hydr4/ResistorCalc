Resistors have three types with respect to bands number
which exist upon it, so a resistor whether to be four-
band, five-band or six-band resistor, and I am going to
discuss how to deal with those types to use this program.
<br><br>
<font color=red> <b> 1# 4-band resistor: </b> </font>
<br>
	In this case, and after choosing "4-Band Resistor"
	radio button in the program, we look at color bands
	starting from the left, so the first two colors would
	be choosen from "1st Band", "2nd Band" lists, and
	they represent the first two digits of resistor's
	value.
	And the third color band on the resistor would be the
	multiplier so you choose its color from "Multiplier"
	list.
	The fourth color band would be the tolerance of the
	resistor, so you need to choose it from "Tolerance"
	list.
	Afeter doing that - properly and I assume - Click on
	"Calculate!"
<br><br>
<font color=red> <b> 2# 5-band resistor: </b> </font>
<br>
	In this case, we will do the same thing we did in
	4-type resistor except we will have a band after
	the first two bands as the third digit of resistor's
	value, and it would be choosen from "3rd Band" list
	from the program.
	Then we continue by inputting the multiplier and the
	tolerance.
<br><br>
<font color=red> <b> 3# 6-band resistor: </b> </font>
<br>
	The only difference between this case and the previous
	one is we add "Temperature Coefficent", which
	represented by "Temp. Coeff." as the last band from
	the left.
